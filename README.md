# VirutalGlobalHackathonSubmission
This feature is a submission for the Virtual Global Hackathon which attempts to solve a rideshare problem in UberLand.

We created a properly unique algorithm that determimes the most optimal location to place a "Gathering Spot" so Uber driver may
pick riders up and deliver them to work. This is an innovative idea and code as instead of using a traditional public transport that 
does not take you exacly where you need to go, or a private Uber which is coslty and releases uncessary amounts of carbon emmisions, 
PickUp Spots allow groups of employees to transit to exaclty where they need to be for a fraction of the cost and emmisions.

This code implements a 4 unique classes each designed to fit a Dijkstra's Algorithm based search to then find the most optimal pickup 
location, using an algorithm designed by us. 

To run this code you must click run and see the results in the console.
